**Sociate** is a full-stack web application for social media. This repository contains the client part of the application, while the backend part can be found in the [sociate-server repository](https://github.com/Deynao1996/social-server).

Explore Sociate, a feature-rich social media platform with dark and light themes, registration, authentication, and real-time chat using socket.io. It allows users to create posts, share media with friends, find new friends, and engage in chat conversations.

Check out the live demo of Sociate: [Sociate Live Demo](https://dbvision-social.netlify.app)

Please note that the demo is hosted on a free hosting service, and the server may automatically go to sleep if there are no requests from the client side. In such cases, it may take 30-60 seconds for the server to wake up when you access the demo.

It's important to know that that some functionality in this demo has been limited for security reasons.
